## 💻 [Who am I?]
Hi, I'm Marco but they calls me Mark or MRK. I love foods and especially pizza 🍕

What I like mostly, it's coding, coding and coding. What I hate mostly, it's when I find the error on code, but I never gave up for this.


## 👾 [What can I do?]

I started with HTML and CSS obviously, then I started to code in JavaScript. When I wanted become full-stack developer, then I learned PHP and structure SQL.

Now, I'm trying to learn JavaScript server-side, but I still code in PHP for fun. On repository I think I will publish more JS than PHP project.
## 💾 [What do I like?]

What you saw the icon, I love floppy disks! Uh... I don't know why. I just love them, like in past they were powerful storage, and now look at them... Only 1.44Mb?!

But they became an iconic for games, such "Do you want save the game? Press 💾".

I love also old operating system, such DOS.
